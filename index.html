    <h2>What is dorkbot?</h2>
    <p>Dorkbot Brighton is a <strong>free, regular, informal, show-and-tell</strong> style meetup of designers, geeks, artists, engineers, students and anyone else who's interested. It's a place for people to show off the strange things they've been doing with electricity, be it a new gadget, a smartphone app, a website, a synthesiser or an artwork. The Brighton Dorkbot is just one of many all over the world. To find one closer to you check out <a href="http://dorkbot.org">the main Dorkbot site</a>.</p>
    <p>Each meetup consists of several pre-organised <strong>speakers/presenters showing off their amazing things</strong> &amp; answer any questions. Then we <strong>hang out, socialise, network and natter</strong> for a bit.
